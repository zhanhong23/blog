                <h1>My Experience During the Movement Control Order</h1>
                <h2>Finally I can improve my coding skill</h2>
                <h3>-May 19, 2020, 11.33pm</h3>
                <p>Due the COVID-19 became more serious , our prime minister implemented the Movement Control Order as a preventive measure and it began on 18 May. Movenment Control Order means that all the education instituions ,companies and others activities will stop or under control until it finish. Hence, all students who like me needs to study online and stay at home. During this MCO , I have using my free time to do some interesting stuff ,such as making a chabot, learning a new programming language and many more. They are quite fun and it improves my skill a lot.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chat_bot">
                <h1>1, Chat Bot</h1>
                <p>Chat bot is the first project that I have been doing during the MCO.  This project actually is the idea that I want to do in the mini-project which need to make a card to the poet to console her. Although my teacher just want us make a simple card using Google Drawing , I think that looks boring so I do on my way. </p>
                <p>I tried to use the Google Chat to make a chat bot and make it automatically chat with the person who joined the group. It will looks like I am trying to console the person. This project looks very cool but I fail and I having the isssue that I can’t get the message and the user in the group. Thus, I try to use another way to make it . </p>
                <p>I also tried to use the Google Could Console’s Pub/Sub to get the messages. However, I found that it needs to paid money so I went through the next plan. When I Google the way to make a simple chat bot, I found a website Dialogflow that let people to make a chat bot with their Machine Learning. My first thought that this website should be very helpful to let me build my own chat bot and the most important thing is that it is able to connect with Google Chat. </p>
                <p>Hence, I start using it to build it but I found that it just able work with Google Chat’s direct message only, group is unable to work. Finally, my friend told me that I could use either webscraping or create a databasa using json. So far, I’m still trying make it success during my free time.I hope it can be done before the MCO finish.</p>

            <div class="js">
                <h1>2, Learning New Programming Language</h1>
                <p>I have learnt Python, C#, Flutter, Dart and Kotlin before. However, I want to learn the Javascript as it can do tons of things such as font-end ( user inferace etc ) and back-end ( data base, server etc ). Thus, I started to make a website something like this blog with Javascript. Nevertheless, I just learnt a little bit as I’m busy so I just build this blog with html and css only. I hope that I can get started again with my Javascript courses as far as soon.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="color_grading">
                <h1>3,Color Grading</h1>
                <p>Color grading always is the one I really want to learn as the solfware that I use for video editing is actually for professional color grading and I don’t to waste it’s potential. Thus,I have started learning how to color grading a video and make it looks professional during this MCO. I have learnt how to watch the scopes and using the curves. However, I have just learnt about two days and I need to continue with my school homeworks so I stopped learning it. I also found that my laptop can’t afford this kind of color grading program that much. I’m still waiting for my new laptop that have a dedicated GPU and it will run smoothly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="challenge">
                <h1>4,The Special Challenge </h1>
                <p>I joined a discord server that created by a programming youtuber Tim and it has a monthly challenge to let his viewer try to solve it. It really fun and a bit quite hard and I have used 14hours to solve the question</p>
                <p>This question is talk about we need to create a encoding algorithm to encode a normal word to code and the type of it should be the one that given on the question. Then, if you can , you could also create a decoder to decode the code back to the original word.</p>
                <p>Actually the algorithm is just need to count the letter that inside the word.</p>
                <p>something like this :<br>
                    AAABBBCCC -> three A letter , three B letter and three C letter <br>
                    so the output will be like:<br>
                    3A3B3C<br></p>
                <p>I love this kind of challenge, it helps me improve my programming skill a lot. However, it really need to use a lot of time to think the way out. Next time, I will improve my coding skill and make my code as short as possible</p>
            </div>

            <div class="last">
                <h1>Stay Home Stay Safe</h1>
                <p>Stay at home and do not simply go outside , clean your hands often and wear mask when you really need to go outside. Protect yourself and protect others. Take care.</p>
